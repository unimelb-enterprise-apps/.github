## External collaborators
All external collaborators should have Unimelb IT access, which can be obtained via a [HR39 form](https://unimelb.service-now.com/hr?id=it_access "HR39"). Add them to an appropriate sub-team of '[External Collaborators](https://github.com/orgs/unimelb-enterprise-apps/teams/external-collaborators "see External Collaborators team")' with at least the repository they are associated with in the group title.

[IT access can be extended](https://unimelb.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6a34786e4f538e800ecb0bd11310c7be "Technical access extension") (short-term).
